============
Introduction
============

Zope2.ZodbBrowser is a web application to browse, inspect and introspect Zope's zodb objects. It is inspired on smalltalk's class browser and zodbbrowsers for zope3. 

There is a demo video available at `YouTube's menttes channel
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOpdnC5zvs/>`_. 

====================================
Using ZodbBrowser with your buildout
====================================

If you already have a buildout for Zope2.13 or Plone4 running, edit 
buildout.cfg to add zope2.zodbbrowser to eggs and zcml sections at buildout
and instance parts respectively.

::

  [buildout]
  ...
  eggs = zope2.zodbbrowser
  ...

Autoinclude is automatically configured to work in Plone but if you are using 
any other systems, make sure to add a zcml slug::

  ...
  [instance]
  ...
  zcml = zope2.zodbbrowser

Then run bin/buildout to make the changes effective.



================
Buildout Install
================

::

  $ svn co http://zodbbrowser.googlecode.com/svn/buildout/ zodbbrowser
  $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
  $ bin/buildout -v
  $ bin/instance fg

==================
Use of zodbbrowser
==================

To access zodbbrowser add /zodbbrowser in your zope instance url, for example:
http://localhost:8080/zodbbrowser
