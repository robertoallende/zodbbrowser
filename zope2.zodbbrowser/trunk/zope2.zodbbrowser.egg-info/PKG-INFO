Description: ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Zope2.ZodbBrowser is a web application to browse, inspect and introspect Zope's zodb objects. It is inspired on smalltalk's class browser and zodbbrowsers for zope3. 
        
        There is a demo video available at `YouTube's menttes channel
        <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOpdnC5zvs/>`_. 
        
        ====================================
        Using ZodbBrowser with your buildout
        ====================================
        
        If you already have a buildout for Zope2.13 or Plone4 running, edit 
        buildout.cfg to add zope2.zodbbrowser to eggs and zcml sections at buildout
        and instance parts respectively.
        
        ::
        
          [buildout]
          ...
          eggs = zope2.zodbbrowser
          ...
        
        Autoinclude is automatically configured to work in Plone but if you are using 
        any other systems, make sure to add a zcml slug::
        
          ...
          [instance]
          ...
          zcml = zope2.zodbbrowser
        
        Then run bin/buildout to make the changes effective.
        
        
        
        ================
        Buildout Install
        ================
        
        ::
        
          $ svn co http://zodbbrowser.googlecode.com/svn/buildout/ zodbbrowser
          $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
          $ bin/buildout -v
          $ bin/instance fg
        
        ==================
        Use of zodbbrowser
        ==================
        
        To access zodbbrowser add /zodbbrowser in your zope instance url, for example:
        http://localhost:8080/zodbbrowser
